                    Don't leave reservations to the last minute.
                    Try to book your reservations as early as possible.
                    If you're not sure about your travel dates, fix the price of cheap flight tickets you've found.
                    Keep an eye on Pegasus' special offers.
                    Keep an eye on seasonal introductory offers.
                    Try not to travel at weekends and during public holidays.
                    Travel outside of peak season.</div>

                <label for="item5">What is the best day of the week to buy plane tickets?</label>
                <div class="answer">There is no one "best" day of the week to buy plane tickets that applies universally to all airlines and routes. However, there are some general trends and tips that may be helpful in finding cheaper flights:
                    Book in advance: Generally, the earlier you book your flight, the more likely you are to get a better price.                   
                    Avoid peak travel times: Flights during holidays and weekends tend to be more expensive. Instead, consider traveling during off-peak times, such as midweek.
                    Be flexible with your travel dates: Sometimes, shifting your travel dates by a day or two can make a significant difference in price. 
                    Set up price alerts: Many travel websites and airlines offer price alert services that will notify you when the price of a particular flight changes. 
                    Consider alternative airports: Sometimes, flying into or out of a smaller airport near your destination can be less expensive.                
                    Ultimately, the best day to buy plane tickets will vary based on the specific route, and timing of your travel plans. It's a good idea to do some research and compare prices across multiple dates to find the best deal for your specific needs.

                <label for="item6">Is it cheaper to book flights at the last minute?</label>
                <div class="answer">Contrary to popular belief, booking flights at the last minute is not necessarily cheaper. In fact, it can often be more expensive, especially during peak travel times when demand for flights is high.
                    Pegasus Airlines use dynamic pricing, which means that the price of a flight can fluctuate based on factors such as demand, time of year, and available seats. When you book a flight at the last minute, you're often competing with other travelers who are also looking to book seats on the same flight. This increased demand can cause prices to rise.               
                    In addition, Pegasus Airlines may sometimes offer discounts for booking in advance, as it helps them to better manage their capacity and plan for the number of passengers on a particular flight.                 
                    That being said, it's generally best to book your flight as far in advance as possible to secure the best price.
